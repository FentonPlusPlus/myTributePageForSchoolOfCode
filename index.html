      <p id="user">John Who?</p>

      <p id="speaker">John Williams! Composer, Pianist, Conductor and perhaps the most famous film composer of all time.</p>

      <p id="user">Oh. What films has he done?</p>

      <p id="speaker">What hasn't he done?! Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Jaws, E.T., Home Alone and Jurassic Park to name a few!</p>

      <p id="user">Oh yer, some of them do look familiar. But... why should I care?</p>

      <p id="speaker">Without film music, the emotional energy of a film would be severely dampened! Scenes would lose feeling and the pacing of the f--... You know what, why don't I just show you. Here, watch this:</p>

      <p id="user">I now completely understand what you mean! But there must be so many composers out there, why is John Williams so special?</p>

      <p id="speaker">Good question! It is completely subjective to everyone of course, but here are a few reasons as to why we think he is completely deserving of both his renown and success:</p>
    </article>

    <ul id="list">
      <li>John Williams studied piano with the prodigy Madame Rosina Lhevinne at Harvard. However, he considered himself not good enough for a career in piano, so decided to focus on composing. In addition to piano, he also plays many other instruments to a high level, including Trombone, Trumpet and percussion.</li>
      <li>He started out as a session pianist for many composers of the 'Golden age of Hollywood' (remember that he thought that he wasn't good enough?!). You can hear his piano playing on the film scores Some Like It Hot, West Side Story and To Kill a Mockingbird, to name a few.</li>
      <li>His symphonic orchestral score to Star Wars marked a return of the use of the orchestra in hollywood film scores, which had been followed by a time of jazz, electronic and noir scores. Itâ€™s popularity shaped much film music over the next few decades and subsequently the scores we hear today. The soundtrack itself is the best selling symphonic album of all time!</li>
      <li>Many great musicians have sought to work with him, from Yo-Yo Ma to Anne-Sophie Mutter to Gustavo Dudamel! In addition, he has worked with legendary directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, George Lucas, Alfonso Cuaron, and is known for a lifelong partnership with Steven Spielberg.</li>
      <li>Despite the industry trend of almost all composers writing music on computers with the aid of virtual instruments, Williams remains old school and still sticks to pencil and paper, writing hours of music for each film on very tight deadlines.</li>
      <li>He holds 2nd place for the most Oscar nominations at 52 noms! 2nd place behind Walt Disney himself. He was also the first composer to be inducted in the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award list. The amount of awards he has won is endless!</li>
      <li>When writing music for Spielberg's film Schindler's List, John Williams was so moved by the film that he told Spielberg he needed a better composer. Spielberg replied, "I know, but they're all dead!"</li>
    </ul>

      <p id="user">Wow, that is an impressive list! You've convinced me. So where can I learn more about John Williams and his music?</p>
